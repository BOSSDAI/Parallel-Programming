Parallel-Programming
====================

This course focuses on analyzing and optimizing the performance of software, in both a single-threaded and 
multi-threaded setting. Students will apply their knowledge of hardware, programming, and assembly to both 
tasks, and thus a strong background in all three topics is required. Single-threaded performance will include 
topics such as code profiling and analysis, loop transformation, analysis of the interaction of the code and 
the memory hierarchy, and assembly level instruction scheduling impacts. Multi-threaded topics will include 
topics such as scalability and load balance.
